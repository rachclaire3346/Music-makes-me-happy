		<h3>Tomorrowland</h3>
		<p>Tomorrowland is one of the largest EDM festivals in the world!</p>
		<p>Located in Boom, Belgium, it is one of the most diverse music festivals that I have ever attended. It is a 3 day festival with people from hundreds of different countires in attendance. Tomorrowland is known for multiple elaborate stages and firework shows.</p>

		<h3>Airbeat One</h3>
		<p>Airbeat One is a smaller festival that is rapidly growing in Germany</p>
		<p>This fewtival is set in a small town in Germany called Neustadt-Glewe. This festival pretends to be a destination festival with a different theme each year. 2016 the there was Asia, 2017 the theme was the United States and the theme for 2018 is going to be England.</p>

		<h3>Suwanee Hulaween</h3>
		<p>Hulaween is a festival held in Live Oak, Florida every October.</p>
		<p>Something that makes Suwanee Hulaween special is that it attracts people of all ages. People would imagine that the festival has a beachy feel because it is in Florida but it is actually set deep in the woods. Some of the stages have art shows set around them including sights such as glowing swings, artists swinging from trees, and sand art tables.</p>

		<h3>Electric Daisy Carnival UK</h3>
		<p>Electric Daisy Carnival UK (EDC UK) is a 3 day American festival brought to Europe.</p>
		<p>EDC is one of the largest festivals in the United States known for very elaborate stages. The European version is located in Milton Keynes, England and lasts only one day. Even though the festival is only one day it is still a large festival. EDC UK contained 5 different stages with many of them being circus tent style.</p>

		<h3>Bonnaroo</h3>
		<p>Bonnaroo is a music festival held in Manchester, Tennessee every june.</p>
		<p>This is a 4 day music festival making it slightly longer than the typical 3 day music festival. Bonnaroo also has a larger variety of music styles than the other festivals that I have attended. Bonnaroo does not have very elaborate stages but what makes it stand out is how friendly everyone at the festival is.</p>

		<h3>Melt!</h3>
		<p>Melt! is a very unique festival because it takes place at an old shipping yard.</p>
		<p>This festival is located in gr√§fenhainichen, Germany. A couple of the festivals stages are located on the beach because the shipping yard is surrounded by water on three sides. Most festivals stop playing music between 1am and 3am but Melt! is a 24 hour festival.</p>
